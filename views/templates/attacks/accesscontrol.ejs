A malicious app tries to access resources they are not allowed to. This is blocked by the
scope parameter of the Connected App. For example, even if the user has the permission to
post on chatter through its permissions, the malicious app will not be able to post on
chatter if the <code>chatter_api</code> scope wasn't enabled for the Connected App.
