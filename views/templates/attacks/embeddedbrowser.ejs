A malicious, but seemingly harmless app is installed on your phone. It comes with an
embedded browser inside the app which is used to launch the User-Agent flow. However, the
embedded browser actually captures username and password while typing. This is something
very difficult to block and requires educating the user to not type credentials in an
embedded browser unless you really trust the app. It's better to work with a Web-Server flow
without client secret or assertion where a trusted mobile browser is used for launching the
auth flow (see lower).
