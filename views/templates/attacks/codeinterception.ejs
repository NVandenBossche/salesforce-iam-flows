A malicious app intercepts the authorization code and tries to use it to get an access
token. This is blocked by using the code_challenge parameter in the authorization
request, which is then checked against the code_verifier parameter in the token request.
The code verifier is 128 bytes of random data with high entropy that's base64url
encoded. The code challenge is the base64url encoded SHA256 hash value of the code
verifier.
