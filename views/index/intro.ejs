                This is a Node.js application with as sole purpose to practice and understand the different OAuth flows
                for authorization on the Salesforce platform. The goal is to help others on their journey to CTA
                (Certified Technical Architect) by providing them with a deeper understanding of Identity and Access
                Management.

                The navigation bar allows you to go the section of a specific flow. Each section will show you a
                sequence diagram of that flow. By clicking the "Show/Hide Details" button you can read a more detailed
                explanation of what is happening in the background. By clicking the "Production" or "Sandbox" buttons,
                you can launch the authorization flow.
